üî® Project features
---
- For this project, I created a custom website with the theme of animals using JavaScript. During the course, I learned how to create a debounce function, which is a technique to delay the execution of a function until a certain period of time has passed. This function can be useful to improve the performance of my website, for example, in cases of events that occur very frequently.
  I also improved my knowledge of class syntax, which is a way to create objects in JavaScript. Classes provide a more structured and organized way to create objects than traditional constructor functions.
  Finally, I learned how to create custom slides for my website. These slides can be used to present information and images of the animals in a dynamic and interactive way.
  Overall, my project involved using the techniques I learned in the course, such as the debounce function, class syntax, and custom slides, to create a unique and engaging website with an animal theme.
